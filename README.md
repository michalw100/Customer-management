# Web application for customer management
A few steps for the project to run:
1. Open the terminal and enter the server folder 
2. cd server --> npm install --> npm run dev.
3. Open a new terminal and enter the client folder
4. cd client --> npm install --> npm run dev.
5. The project is not connected to my database - to maintain privacy. Paste the link to your mongoDB in the file - connectTodb or create .env file with URIDB and paste the link.
enjoy :)
